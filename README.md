Welcome! This repository contains solutions, notes, and files related to the Nand2Tetris course. 

Course Overview

    Nand2Tetris is a fascinating journey that takes you from the very basics of digital logic to building a complete computer system.
    The course covers everything from elementary logic gates to high-level programming languages.
    By the end of this course, youâ€™ll have a deep understanding of how computers work at the hardware and software level!

Contents

    Week 1: Elementary Logic Gates
        Understand truth tables, Boolean expressions, and canonical representation.
        Learn about basic logic gates: NOT, AND, OR, and XOR.
        Explore how NAND gates can be used to construct all other gates.

    Week 2: Building Blocks
        Dive into more complex chips and their implementations.
        Explore composite gates and their interconnections.
        Understand the art of logic design.

    Week 3: Sequential Logic
        Design and implement memory hierarchy.
        Construct flip-flop gates, registers, and RAM units of arbitrary sizes.

    Week 4: Machine Language
        Study the instruction set (binary and assembly versions).
        Write low-level assembly programs.
        Run programs on a CPU emulator.

    Week 5: Computer Architecture
        Build the Hack computer architecture.
        Implement the Hack CPU and memory components.

    Week 6: High-Level Language
        Develop a virtual machine.
        Create a compiler for a simple, Java-like programming language.

    Week 7: Assembler
        Dive into the world of assembly language.
        Write an assembler to convert Hack assembly code to machine code.

    Week 8: Virtual Machine I: Stack Arithmetic
        Explore stack-based computation.
        Implement stack arithmetic commands.

    Week 9: Virtual Machine II: Program Control
        Handle branching and function calls.
        Implement control flow commands.

    Week 10: High-Level Language II
        Extend the high-level language compiler.
        Add support for functions and control structures.

    Week 11: Compiler I: Syntax Analysis
        Learn about lexical analysis and parsing.
        Build the tokenizer and parser for the Jack language.

    Week 12: Compiler II: Code Generation
        Generate intermediate code.
        Translate Jack code to VM code.

    Week 13: Operating System
        Develop an operating system for the Hack platform.
        Implement memory management, file I/O, and multitasking.
